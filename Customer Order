#In this SQL, I queried a database with multiple tables to answer the following questions.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
JOIN customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.quantity >2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
